# A repo to record my learning of Linked List in python.

Linked list is a simple data structure in programming, which obviously is used to store data and retrieve it accordingly. To make it easier to imagine, it is more like a dynamic array in which data elements are linked via pointers (i.e. the present record points to its next record and the next one points to the record that comes after it, this goes on until the end of the structure) rather than being tightly packed.

There are two types of linked list:

Single-Linked List: In this, the nodes point to the node immediately after it
Doubly Linked List: In this, the nodes not only reference the node next to it but also the node before it.
